Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. This space documents my practical development in Cyber Security — combining offensive techniques, detection concepts, and supporting tools written in Python. All work is created in structured, authorised environments, with a clear focus on legality, professionalism, and ethical learning.

I am currently seeking a **graduate or junior role** in Cyber Security, either as a **Junior Security Analyst** or **Junior Penetration Tester**. I am eager to apply the skills and concepts shown here in a collaborative, operational environment where I can continue learning and contribute meaningfully to security outcomes.

## 👋 About Me

I am a Cyber Security professional with a 1st Class BSc (Hons) in Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security from Coventry University and an MSc with Distinction in Cyber Security Management from the University of Warwick.

My academic background bridges technical and strategic security disciplines. At Coventry University, I developed hands-on experience in Penetration Testing, Digital Forensics, Applied Cryptography, and Exploit Development — alongside the legal and ethical frameworks that underpin responsible practice. My MSc focused on Cyber Risk, Audit and Compliance, Network Security, and Human Factors. 

My dissertation — *An Effective Hybrid Botnet Approach Based on Multi-Layered Early Detection for the Internet of Things* — explored lightweight methods for identifying botnet activity in IoT environments, and reflects my continuing interest in proactive and scalable network defence.

Alongside my academic work, I have 8+ years of experience in IT support, providing me with a strong operational understanding of infrastructure, user environments, and endpoint systems — now redirected toward cyber security objectives.
